title: Run flows on Kubernetes
description: Learn how to run flows on Kubernetes using containers.
---

This guide explains how to run flows on Kubernetes.
Though much of the guide is general to any Kubernetes cluster, it focuses on 
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Prefect is tested against 
Kubernetes 1.26.0 and newer minor versions.

## Prerequisites

1. A Prefect Cloud account
2. A cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) account
3. Python and Prefect [installed](/3.0/get-started/install/)
4. Helm [installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) 
5. Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)[installed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) 
6. Admin access for Prefect Cloud and your cloud provider. You can downgrade it after this setup.

## Create a cluster

If you already have one, skip ahead to the next section.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">

    One easy way to get set up with a cluster in EKS is with [`eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/).
    Node pools can be backed by either EC2 instances or FARGATE.
    Choose FARGATE so there's less to manage.
    The following command takes around 15 minutes and must not be interrupted:

    ```bash
    # Replace the cluster name with your own value
    eksctl create cluster --fargate --name <CLUSTER-NAME>

    # Authenticate to the cluster.
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <CLUSTER-NAME>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">

    You can get a GKE cluster up and running with a few commands using the 
    [`gcloud` CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
    This builds a bare-bones cluster that is accessible over the open 
    internet - but it should **not** be used in a production environment.
    To deploy the cluster, your project must have a VPC network configured.

    First, authenticate to GCP by setting the following configuration options:

    ```bash
    # Authenticate to gcloud
    gcloud auth login

    # Specify the project & zone to deploy the cluster to
    # Replace the project name with your GCP project name
    gcloud config set project <GCP-PROJECT-NAME>
    gcloud config set compute/zone <AVAILABILITY-ZONE>
    ```

    Next, deploy the cluster. This command takes ~15 minutes to complete.
    Once the cluster has been created, authenticate to the cluster.

    ```bash
    # Create cluster
    # Replace the cluster name with your own value
    gcloud container clusters create <CLUSTER-NAME> --num-nodes=1 \
    --machine-type=n1-standard-2

    # Authenticate to the cluster
    gcloud container clusters <CLUSTER-NAME> --region <AVAILABILITY-ZONE>
    ```

<Warning>
**GCP potential errors**

```
ERROR: (gcloud.container.clusters.create) ResponseError: code=400, message=Service account "000000000000-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" is disabled.
```
- You must enable the default service account in the IAM console, or 
specify a different service account with the appropriate permissions.

```

```
- Organization policy blocks creation of external (public) IPs. Override 
this policy (if you have the appropriate permissions) under the `Organizational Policy` 
page within IAM.


</Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure">

    Create an AKS cluster using the 
    [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli), 
    or use the Cloud Shell directly from the Azure portal [shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

    First, authenticate to Azure if not already done.

    ```bash
      az login
    ```

    Next, deploy the cluster - this command takes ~4 minutes to complete. 
    Once the cluster is created, authenticate to the cluster.

    ```bash

      # Create a Resource Group at the desired location, e.g. westus
      az group create --name <RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME> --location <LOCATION>

      # Create a kubernetes cluster with default kubernetes version, default SKU load balancer (Standard) and default vm set type (VirtualMachineScaleSets)
      az aks create --resource-group <RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME> --name <CLUSTER-NAME>

      # Configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster
      az aks get-credentials --resource-group <RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME> --name <CLUSTER-NAME>

      # Verify the connection by listing the cluster nodes
      kubectl get nodes
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create a container registry

Besides a cluster, the other critical resource is a container registry.
A registry is not strictly required, but in most cases you'll want to use custom 
images and/or have more control over where images are stored.
If you already have a registry, skip ahead to the next section.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">

    Create a registry using the AWS CLI and authenticate the docker daemon to 
    that registry:

    ```bash
    # Replace the image name with your own value
    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <IMAGE-NAME>

    # Login to ECR
    # Replace the region and account ID with your own values
    aws ecr get-login-password --region <REGION> | docker login \
      --username AWS --password-stdin <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">
    Create a registry using the gcloud CLI and authenticate the docker daemon to 
    that registry:

    ```bash
    # Create artifact registry repository to host your custom image
    # Replace the repository name with your own value; it can be the
    # same name as your image
    gcloud artifacts repositories create <REPOSITORY-NAME> \
    --repository-format=docker --location=us

    # Authenticate to artifact registry
    gcloud auth configure-docker us-docker.pkg.dev
    ```
  </Tab>
<Tab title="Azure">
    Create a registry using the Azure CLI and authenticate the docker daemon to 
    that registry:

    ```bash
    # Name must be a lower-case alphanumeric
    # Tier SKU can easily be updated later, e.g. az acr update --name <REPOSITORY-NAME> --sku Standard
    az acr create --resource-group <RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME> \
      --name <REPOSITORY-NAME> \
      --sku Basic

    # Attach ACR to AKS cluster
    # You need Owner, Account Administrator, or Co-Administrator role on your Azure subscription as per Azure docs
    az aks update --resource-group <RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME> --name <CLUSTER-NAME> --attach-acr <REPOSITORY-NAME>

    # You can verify AKS can now reach ACR
    az aks check-acr --resource-group RESOURCE-GROUP-NAME> --name <CLUSTER-NAME> --acr <REPOSITORY-NAME>.azurecr.io

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create a Kubernetes work pool

[Work pools](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/work-pools/) allow you to manage deployment 
infrastructure.
This section shows you how to configure the default values for your 
Kubernetes base job template.
These values can be overridden by individual deployments.

Switch to the Prefect Cloud UI to create a new Kubernetes work pool. 
(Alternatively, you could use the Prefect CLI to create a work pool.)

1. Click on the **Work Pools** tab on the left sidebar
2. Click the **+** button at the top of the page
3. Select **Kubernetes** as the work pool type
4. Click **Next** to configure the work pool settings
5. Set the `namespace` field to `prefect`

<Note>
If you set a different namespace, use your selected namespace instead of `prefect` in all commands below.
</Note>


You may come back to this page to configure the work pool options at any time.

### Configure work pool options

Here are some popular configuration options.

**Environment Variables**

Add environment variables to set when starting a flow run.
If you are using a Prefect-maintained image and haven't overwritten the image's 
entrypoint, you can specify Python packages to install at runtime with `{"EXTRA_PIP_PACKAGES":"my_package"}`.
For example `{"EXTRA_PIP_PACKAGES":"pandas==1.2.3"}` installs pandas version 1.2.3.
Alternatively, you can specify package installation in a custom Dockerfile, which  
allows you to use image caching.
As shown below, Prefect can help create a Dockerfile with your flow code and the 
packages specified in a `requirements.txt` file baked in.

**Namespace**

Set the Kubernetes namespace to create jobs within, such as `prefect`. By default, set 
to **default**.

**Image**

Specify the Docker container image for created jobs.
If not set, the latest Prefect 3 image is used (for example, `prefecthq/prefect:3-latest`).
You can override this on each deployment through `job_variables`.

**Image Pull Policy**

Select from the dropdown options to specify when to pull the image.
When using the `IfNotPresent` policy, make sure to use unique image tags, or  
old images may get cached on your nodes.

**Finished Job TTL**

Number of seconds before finished jobs are automatically cleaned up by the Kubernetes 
controller.
Set to 60 so completed flow runs are cleaned up after a minute.

**Pod Watch Timeout Seconds**

Number of seconds for pod creation to complete before timing out.
Consider setting to 300, especially if using a **serverless** type node pool, as 
these tend to have longer startup times.

**Kubernetes cluster config**

Specify a KubernetesClusterConfig block to configure the Kubernetes cluster for job creation.
In most cases, leave the cluster config blank since the worker should already have appropriate 
access and permissions.
We recommend using this setting when deploying a worker to a cluster that differs from the one 
executing the flow runs.

<Note>
**Advanced Settings**

    Modify the default base job template to add other fields or delete existing 
    fields.

    Select the **Advanced** tab and edit the JSON representation of the base job template.

    For example, to set a CPU request, add the following section under variables:

    ```json
    "cpu_request": {
      "title": "CPU Request",
      "description": "The CPU allocation to request for this pod.",
      "default": "default",
      "type": "string"
    },
    ```

    Next add the following to the first `containers` item under `job_configuration`:

    ```json
    ...
    "containers": [
      {
        ...,
        "resources": {
          "requests": {
            "cpu": "{{ cpu_request }}"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    ...
    ```

    Running deployments with this work pool will request the specified CPU.
</Note>

After configuring the work pool settings, move to the next screen.

Give the work pool a name and save.

Your new Kubernetes work pool should appear in the list of work pools.

## Create a Prefect Cloud API key

If you already have a Prefect Cloud API key, you can skip these steps.

To create a Prefect Cloud API key:

1. Log in to the Prefect Cloud UI.
1. Click on your profile avatar picture in the top right corner.
1. Click on your name to go to your profile settings.
1. In the left sidebar, click on [API Keys](https://app.prefect.cloud/my/api-keys).
1. Click the **+** button to create a new API key.
1. Securely store the API key, ideally using a password manager.

title: What's new in Prefect 3.0
sidebarTitle: What's new
---

Prefect 3.0 introduces a number of enhancements to the OSS product: a new events & automations backend for event-driven workflows and observability, improved runtime performance, autonomous task execution and a streamlined caching layer based on transactional semantics.

Most Prefect 2.0 users can upgrade without changes to their existing workflows. Please review the [upgrade guide](/3.0/resources/upgrade-to-prefect-3) for more information.

<Info>
**Prefect 2.0** refers to the 2.x lineage of the open source prefect package, and **Prefect 3.0** refers exclusively to the 3.x lineage of the prefect package. Neither version is strictly tied to any aspect of Prefect's commercial product, [Prefect Cloud](/3.0/manage/cloud). 
</Info>

## Open source events and automation system

One of the largest features in Prefect 3.0 is the introduction of the events and automation system to the open source package. Previously exclusive to Prefect Cloud, this system now allows all users to create event-driven workflows and automate their system based on the presence or absence of observable events. 

With this new capability, you can trigger actions based on specific event payloads, cancel runs if certain conditions aren't met, or automate workflow runs based on external events. For instance, you could initiate a data processing pipeline automatically when a new file lands in an S3 bucket. The system also enables you to receive notifications for various system health events, giving you greater visibility and control over your workflows.

## New transactional interface

Another major addition in Prefect 3.0 is the new transactional interface. This powerful feature makes it easier than ever to build resilient and idempotent pipelines. With the transactional interface, you can group tasks into transactions, automatically roll back side effects on failure, and significantly improve your pipeline's idempotency and resilience.

For example, you can define rollback behaviors for your tasks, ensuring that any side effects are cleanly reversed if a transaction fails. This is particularly useful for maintaining data consistency in complex workflows involving multiple steps or external systems.

## Flexible task execution

Prefect 3.0 has no restrictions on where tasks can run. Tasks can be nested within other tasks, allowing for more flexible and modular workflows; they can also be called outside of flows, essentially enabling Prefect to function as a background task service. You can now run tasks autonomously, apply them asynchronously, or delay their execution as needed. This flexibility opens up new possibilities for task management and execution strategies in your data pipelines.

## Enhanced client-side engine

Prefect 3.0 comes with a thoroughly reworked client-side engine that brings several improvements to the table. You can now nest tasks within other tasks, adding a new level of modularity to your workflows. The engine also supports generator tasks, allowing for more flexible and efficient handling of iterative processes.

One of the most significant changes is that all code now runs on the main thread by default. This change improves performance and leads to more intuitive behavior, especially when dealing with shared resources or non-thread-safe operations.

## Improved artifacts and variables

Prefect 3.0 enhances the artifacts system with new types, including progress bars and image artifacts. These additions allow for richer, more informative task outputs, improving the observability of your workflows.

The variables system has also been upgraded to support arbitrary JSON, not just strings. This expansion allows for more complex and structured data to be stored and retrieved as variables, increasing the flexibility of your workflow configurations.

## Workers

Workers were first introduced in Prefect 2.0 as next-generation agents, and are now standard in Prefect 3.0. Workers offer a stronger governance model for infrastructure, improved monitoring of jobs and work pool/queue health, and more flexibility in choosing compute layers, resulting in a more robust and scalable solution for managing the execution of your workflows across various environments.

Worker logs are now sent to the API only if a worker ID is present, indicating a connection to Prefect Cloud. This change simplifies the logging configuration and ensures logs are only sent when supported by the backend. The `PREFECT_EXPERIMENTS_WORKER_LOGGING_TO_API_ENABLED` environment variable has been removed, and users should update their configurations to align with the new logging behavior.

## Performance enhancements

Prefect 3.0 doesn't just bring new features; it also delivers significant performance improvements. Users running massively parallel workflows on distributed systems such as Dask and Ray will notice substantial speedups. In some benchmark cases, we've observed up to a 98% reduction in runtime overhead. These performance gains translate directly into faster execution times and more efficient resource utilization for your data pipelines.

## Release notes

See release notes for each released version in the [Gitub repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/releases).

## Define a flow

Start simple with a flow that just logs a message.
In a directory named `flows`, create a file named `hello.py` with the following contents:

```python
from prefect import flow, tags
from prefect.logging import get_run_logger

@flow
def hello(name: str = "Marvin"):
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with tags("local"):
        hello()
```

Run the flow locally with `python hello.py` to verify that it works.
Use the `tags` context manager to tag the flow run as `local`.
This step is not required, but does add some helpful metadata.

## Define a Prefect deployment

Prefect has two recommended options for creating a deployment with dynamic infrastructure.
You can define a deployment in a Python script using the `flow.deploy` mechanics or in a 
`prefect.yaml` definition file.
The `prefect.yaml` file currently allows for more customization in terms of push and pull 
steps.

To learn about the Python deployment creation method with `flow.deploy` see 
[Workers](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-examples/docker/).

The [`prefect.yaml`](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/prefect-yaml/#managing-deployments) file is used 
by the `prefect deploy` command to deploy your flows.
As a part of that process it also builds and pushes your image.
Create a new file named `prefect.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
# Generic metadata about this project
name: flows
prefect-version: 3.0.0

# build section allows you to manage and build docker images
build:
- prefect_docker.deployments.steps.build_docker_image:
    id: build-image
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.4.0
    image_name: "{{ $PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME }}"
    tag: latest
    dockerfile: auto
    platform: "linux/amd64"

# push section allows you to manage if and how this project is uploaded to remote locations
push:
- prefect_docker.deployments.steps.push_docker_image:
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.4.0
    image_name: "{{ build-image.image_name }}"
    tag: "{{ build-image.tag }}"

# pull section allows you to provide instructions for cloning this project in remote 
locations
pull:
- prefect.deployments.steps.set_working_directory:
    directory: /opt/prefect/flows

# the definitions section allows you to define reusable components for your deployments
definitions:
  tags: &common_tags
    - "eks"
  work_pool: &common_work_pool
    name: "kubernetes"
    job_variables:
      image: "{{ build-image.image }}"

# the deployments section allows you to provide configuration for deploying flows
deployments:
- name: "default"
  tags: *common_tags
  schedule: null
  entrypoint: "flows/hello.py:hello"
  work_pool: *common_work_pool

- name: "arthur"
  tags: *common_tags
  schedule: null
  entrypoint: "flows/hello.py:hello"
  parameters:
    name: "Arthur"
  work_pool: *common_work_pool
```

We define two deployments of the `hello` flow: `default` and `arthur`.
By specifying `dockerfile: auto`, Prefect automatically creates a dockerfile 
that installs any `requirements.txt` and copies over the current directory.

You can pass a custom Dockerfile instead with `dockerfile: Dockerfile` or 
`dockerfile: path/to/Dockerfile`.
We are specifically building for the `linux/amd64` platform.
This specification is often necessary when images are built on Macs with M series chips 
but run on cloud provider instances.

<Note>
**Deployment specific build, push, and pull**

    You can override the build, push, and pull steps for each deployment.
    This allows for more custom behavior, such as specifying a different image for each 
    deployment.
</Note>

Define your requirements in a `requirements.txt` file:

```
prefect>=3.0.0
prefect-docker>=0.4.0
prefect-kubernetes>=0.3.1
```

The directory should now look something like this:

```
.
├── prefect.yaml
└── flows
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── hello.py
```

### Tag images with a Git SHA

If your code is stored in a GitHub repository, it's good practice to tag your images
with the Git SHA of the code used to build it.
Do this in the `prefect.yaml` file with a few minor modifications, since it's not yet 
an option with the Python deployment creation method.

Use the `run_shell_script` command to grab the SHA and pass it to the `tag` 
parameter of `build_docker_image`:

```yaml
build:
- prefect.deployments.steps.run_shell_script:
    id: get-commit-hash
    script: git rev-parse --short HEAD
    stream_output: false
- prefect_docker.deployments.steps.build_docker_image:
    id: build-image
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.4.0
    image_name: "{{ $PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME }}"
    tag: "{{ get-commit-hash.stdout }}"
    dockerfile: auto
    platform: "linux/amd64"
```

Set the SHA as a tag for easy identification in the UI:

```yaml
definitions:
  tags: &common_tags
    - "eks"
    - "{{ get-commit-hash.stdout }}"
  work_pool: &common_work_pool
    name: "kubernetes"
    job_variables:
      image: "{{ build-image.image }}"
```

## Authenticate to Prefect

Before deploying the flows to Prefect, you need to authenticate through the Prefect CLI.
You also need to ensure that all of your flow's dependencies are present at `deploy` time.

This example uses a virtual environment to ensure consistency across environments.

```bash
# Create a virtualenv & activate it
virtualenv prefect-demo
source prefect-demo/bin/activate

# Install dependencies of your flow
prefect-demo/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

# Authenticate to Prefect & select the appropriate
# workspace to deploy your flows to
prefect-demo/bin/prefect cloud login
```

## Deploy the flows

You're ready to deploy your flows to build your images.
The image name determines its registry.
You have configured our `prefect.yaml` file to get the image name from the 
`PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME` environment variable, so set that first:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">

    ```bash
    export PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME=<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/<IMAGE-NAME>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">

    ```bash
    export PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME=us-docker.pkg.dev/<GCP-PROJECT-NAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>/<IMAGE-NAME>
    ```
  </Tab>
<Tab title="Azure">

    ```bash
    export PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME=<REPOSITORY-NAME>.azurecr.io/<IMAGE-NAME>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To deploy your flows, ensure your Docker daemon is running. Deploy all the 
flows with `prefect deploy --all` or deploy them individually by name: `prefect deploy 
-n hello/default` or `prefect deploy -n hello/arthur`.

## Run the flows

Once the deployments are successfully created, you can run them from the UI or the CLI:

```bash
prefect deployment run hello/default
prefect deployment run hello/arthur
```

You can now check the status of your two deployments in the UI.
